# Virtualisation

# Overview
- The process of creating a virtual version of a computer so that multiple systems can run on one physical machine.

## Key Concepts
- Hypervisor - Software that creates and manages Virtual Machines (VMs).
- Virtual Machine (VM) - A fully isolated virtual computer with its own OS, CPU and RAM allocation, and storage.
- Type 1 hypervisor (Bare-Metal) - Runs directly on physical hardware. Used in enterprise environments.
- Type 2 hypervisor (Hosted) - Runs within an operating system. Used for personal labs.
- Containers - Lightweight virtual environments that share the host OS kernel.
- Container Images - Template used to create containers.
- Resource Allocation - Assigning CPU, RAM, and storage to VMs.
- Snapshots - Saved states of a VM, allowing you to restore it.

## Relevance
- Enables efficient hardware usage and system isolation. Essential for cybersecurity labs, development, testing, and server management.
