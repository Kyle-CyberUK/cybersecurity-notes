# Local Area Network (LAN)

## Overview
- A Local Area Network is a private computer network that interconnects devices within a geographical area.

## Key Concepts
- A switch is a dedicated networking device that connects multiple devices through ethernet ports.
- A router connects networks and transfers data between them using a process called routing.
- A network topology refers to the physical or logical arrangement of nodes (devices) and connections in a network.
- Subnetting is the process of dividing a larger network into smaller subnetworks.
- The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) links a device's IP address to its MAC address.
- IP addresses are assigned manually or automatically using a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server.

## Relevance
- A LAN is important because it provides a private, high-speed foundation for devices to connect and share resources.
