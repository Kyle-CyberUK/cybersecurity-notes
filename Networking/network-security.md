# Network Security

## Overview
- Network security involves monitoring and controlling incoming and outgoing traffic, preventing attacks, and ensuring secure communication between systems.

## Key Concepts
- Firewalls control traffic based on predefined rules.
- Port forwarding redirects incoming traffic from a specific port on a router’s public IP address to a specific device and port inside a local network.
- VPNs create encrypted tunnels that securely connect remote users or networks over the internet.
- Routers and switches control how data travels across networks efficiently and securely.
- VLANs segment networks to improve efficiency and security.

## Relevance
- Network security is essential to protect sensitive data and systems from attackers and threats.
