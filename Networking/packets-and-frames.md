# Packets and Frames

## Overview
- Packets and frames are small units of data used to transmit larger messages across a network, they exist at different OSI layers.

## Key Concepts
- At the Data Link layer, packets are encapsulated into frames.
- Frames contain MAC addresses delivered locally.
- Packets contain IP addresses for routing across networks.
- Packets include several important headers added during encapsulation.

## Packet or Frame
- Packets operate at the network layer, delivering IP addresses across multiple networks.
- Frames operate at the data link layer, delivering MAC addresses within a LAN.

## Relevance
- Can help diagnose connectivity and routing issues.
