# Overview
- The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is a 7-layer networking framework that defines how devices send, receive and interpret data.

## Key Concepts
- Separates network communication into different logical layers.
- Each layer performs a specific function.
- Undergoes processes where information is added at each stage (encapsulation)
- Isolates networking issues during troubleshooting.

## Layers
1. Physical
2. Data Link
3. Network
4. Transport
5. Session
6. Presentation
7. Application

## Relevance
- Helps identify where a network issue could be occurring.
